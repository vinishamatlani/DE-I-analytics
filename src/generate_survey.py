"""
Synthetic engagement-survey generator.

Builds a complete annual survey for a fictional European services group
(~3,800 invited employees across 4 countries and 148 teams):

    data/teams.csv             one row per team, with its manager
    data/survey_responses.csv  one row per *invited* employee - answers only
                               where the person actually responded
    data/survey_comments.csv   free-text verbatims

The invite list is included in full, non-respondents and all, because response
rate and non-response bias are part of the analysis rather than a footnote.

Everything is stdlib with a fixed seed, so the files are byte-identical on
every machine. The effects deliberately planted here - the true driver
weights, the team variation, the comment themes and the response bias - are
listed in data/README.md so the analysis can be judged on whether it recovers
them.
