"""
Module 3 - What people wrote.

Free text is where a survey stops being a scoreboard and starts being useful,
and it is also where analysis is easiest to fake. So this module does three
things in order: it measures the volume and tone of what people wrote, it
*scores its own accuracy* against a labelled set before quoting any of it, and
only then draws conclusions.

Two rules govern everything below. Nothing is ever inferred about an
individual - the unit is a theme inside a group. And no verbatim is published
from a group too small to hide in.
