Module 1 - Participation and scores.

Before any result is quoted, two questions have to be answered: who actually
answered, and how much of what we are looking at could be noise. Only then do
the scores mean anything.

Order of business:
  1. response rate, and who is missing from it
  2. the headline - engagement index and eNPS, with intervals
  3. dimension scores, ranked, with confidence intervals
  4. the same scores by department, tested rather than eyeballed
  5. team-level spread, and the confidentiality rule that governs it
